         font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
         font-size: large;
         padding: 20px;}

.money { color: #008000	;
         border-bottom: 1px dotted #0000FF; }

Write the CSS for an id that will be absolutely positioned on a page 20 pixels from the top and 40 pixels from the right. This area should have a light gray background and a solid border.

        right: 40px;
			background-color: #CCCCCC;
			border: 1px solid #000000; }
